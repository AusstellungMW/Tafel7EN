On April 18, 1945, the American military government appointed Robert Gustav Willy Mull as mayor of Wolfenbüttel, following the recommendation of Hubert Schlebusch, the first postwar Minister President of Brunswick. Mull, a former prominent district council representative of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), had been forced into retirement by the National Socialists in 1933 when they took power. In 1944, during the Aktion Gitter crackdown, he was imprisoned for several weeks in the Arbeitserziehungslager (labor re-education camp) in Watenstedt/Salzgitter.

Fritz Ramien, who had served as mayor during the Nazi era, was arrested by the Allies in early May 1945. Like many members of the Nazi elite—including active and prominent National Socialists, SS personnel, and senior administrative officials—he was interned at Staumühle camp under asset seizure until 1947.

On April 29, 1945, a six-member council was convened, consisting of prominent local figures, former trade unionists, and members of the SPD and Communist Party (KPD). This group was tasked with rebuilding democratic municipal administrative structures. Among its earliest members was the industrialist Curt Mast, as well as Otto Rüdiger, whom the British officially appointed as Mull’s deputy in September. A Social Democrat, Rüdiger had been the head of the Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse (local health insurance fund) until early 1933 and had suffered three months of imprisonment in Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1944.

<br>In October 1945, another major denazification campaign was launched, this time targeting all residents of Wolfenbüttel. Under the category of “Prominent National Socialists,” Mayor Mull, future district administrator Ernst Kunkel, and a municipal official compiled records of all known local representatives of the Nazi regime. This resulted in a registry of the former local Nazi elite and the so-called "Old Fighters" (Alte Kämpfer—NSDAP members who had joined before March 1, 1933).

Within just a few days, the administration identified more than 321 "Prominent National Socialists" in Wolfenbüttel alone, including 45 women.

<br>On September 15, 1946, Wolfenbüttel held its first democratic municipal election since the war. Following the introduction of the British municipal constitution six months earlier, Willy Mull was confirmed as Stadtdirektor (city manager), while Otto Rüdiger was reaffirmed as the political mayor. </p>
